Data Structures
- Time is stored as an integer (hours, minutes, seconds). Uses java.util.Date Class to store the data.
- Patient Data is stored using a hash map. By using a hash map the nurses can look up a patients record accordingly using the right key (HC #). The value (patient record object) associated with the key is stored as a LinkedHashSet so that the order is preserved.
Patient Record Class
- Strings are used for variables, (Name, Birthdate)
- Integer are used to store Health Card #
- LinkedHashSet<HashMap<Object Date, Double> are used to store vital signs -- temperature, blood pressure, heart rate). It is a set of HashMaps with the Time as keys and the values as the values for temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. 
- LinkedHashSet<HashMap<Object Date, String> are used to store symptoms. It is a set of HashMaps with the keys as the Time and values as the text description for each symptom
Hospital Class
- Collection of patient records is stored using a HashMap. By using a HashMap, the nurses can look up a patient’s record accordingly using the right key (Health Card Number). The values associated with the key are the individual Patient Records.
- Each policy is stored as a constant. Urgent age, minimum heart rate, maximum heart rate,  systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure are stored as an integer, and urgent temperature is stored as a double. 
Triage Class
- Patient Condition stored as a string that states if patient is improving or worsening.
- Lists of patients is stored as an ArrayList<Integer>. The list of patients is an ArrayList of Health Card Numbers.


File Format of Patient Record
At the beginning of the file there Header with title Patient Data
The following line has the name of the patient name, birth date and health card number.
Then the following line has the arrival time to the hospital and time seen by doctor.
The next line has a section for vital signs of the patient(i.e. temperature, blood pressure and heart rate).
The next line has a list of symptoms the patient has, with a line break before and after the symptoms.
At the end of the file is the patient’s urgency number.
The name of the file will be the health card number of the patient.
